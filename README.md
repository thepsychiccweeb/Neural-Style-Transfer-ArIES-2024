# Neural-Style-Transfer-ArIES-2024

This project is based upon the research paper "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" (source in documentation), I've uploaded the original code written by the the authors also.
Then based on this research paper I've built my own implementation of the code and deployed it on streamlit (https://neural-style-transfer-demo-4wyneqrz5z9ntgmnyghfjs.streamlit.app/).
we would need numpy, tensorflow==2.0, matplotlib.pyplot, cv2, PIL, altair and tensorflow_hub to fully implement this code.

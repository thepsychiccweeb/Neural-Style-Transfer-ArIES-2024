# Neural-Style-Transfer-ArIES-2024

This project is based upon the research paper "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style" (source in documentation), I've uploaded the original code written by the the authors also.
Then based on this research paper I've built my own implementation of the code and deployed it on streamlit (https://neural-style-transfer-demo-4wyneqrz5z9ntgmnyghfjs.streamlit.app/).

To run this code you would need to download vgg19 weights from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saksham219/vgg19-weights (its too big to be uploaded on github)
required libraries:
numpy
tensorflow==2.0
matplotlib
cv2
PIL
altair
tensorflow_hub
